HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - layout/structure of a webpage. 
- Made up of tags, with data being in between them. 

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - a language that interacts with and styles HTML, changing the way HTML looks by following a series of rules. 

- Two important tags allow us to divide our webpage into sections: 
<div></div> the vertical division of a webpage
and 
<span> </span> section of a webpage inside a text (for example)

'#' to access an id (when styling)
. to access a class (when styling)
