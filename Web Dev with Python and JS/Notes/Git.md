Notes

Git: A version control tool in order to maintain different versions and organize code. 
- Git can keep track of changes made to code, synchronize code between different people, test changes to code without losing the original, and revert back to old versions of code.
- GitHub is a website that stores Git repositories on the internet to facilitate the collaboration that Git allows for. A repository is simply a place to keep track of code and all the changes to code.

GIT COMMANDS:

- git clone <url> : take a repository stored on a server (like GitHub) and downloads it
- git add <filename(s)> : add files to the staging area to be included in the next commit
- git commit -m "message" : take a snapshot of the repository and save it with a message about the changes
- git commit -am <filename(s)> "message" : add files and commit changes all in one
- git status : print what is currently going on with the repository
- git push : push any local changes (commits) to a remote server
- git pull : pull any remote changes from a remote server to a local computer
- git log : print a history of all the commits that have been made
- git reflog : print a list of all the different references to commits
- git reset --hard <commit> : reset the repository to a given commit
- git reset --hard origin/master : reset the repository to its original state (e.g. the version cloned from GitHub)

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - layout/structure of a webpage. 
- Made up of tags, with data being in between them. 

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - a language that interacts with and styles HTML, changing the way HTML looks by following a series of rules. 

- Two important tags allow us to divide our webpage into sections: 
<div></div> the vertical division of a webpage
and 
<span> </span> section of a webpage inside a text (for example)

# to access an id (when styling)
. to access a class (when styling)
