Notes

Git: A version control tool in order to maintain different versions and organize code. 
- Git can keep track of changes made to code, synchronize code between different people, test changes to code without losing the original, and revert back to old versions of code.
- GitHub is a website that stores Git repositories on the internet to facilitate the collaboration that Git allows for. A repository is simply a place to keep track of code and all the changes to code.
